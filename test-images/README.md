# test-images

This folder holds images for testing and development.

- Use these images for UI mockups and frontend tests.
- Add new images with clear names (e.g., `icon-search.svg`).
- Prefer SVG for icons; use PNG if needed.

This is temporary until we set up official image storage.

Contact the project lead for questions.
